Baker grillers group project 1 code review:
members Thomas, Micheal, and Ashley


first impression the code is well organized and commented for explanation though is simple enough to not need it.

first complaint is that the ui isn't consistent throughout each menu not a problem functionally just aesthetically. 

stats form is very detailed and comprehensive with plenty of stats.

the BG Sports Stats form has the best ui and easily shows all three sports 

the ability to change between light and dark mode is nice as well as choice of font.

 the code is clear and free from errors and easy to read 

over all very functional and user friendly.
